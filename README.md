# Swipe!

This little website is an exploration of the interaction design of [Tinder](https://tinder.com/). In this dating app you can famously swipe the picture of a person to the right if you like them or the left if you don't. The way the picture moved intrigued me ever since I first tried it out.

The swipe movement is a combination of the picture moving with the pointer along the x- and y-axis and rotating depending on the amount of movement along the x-axis. The direction of rotation depends on wether you started swiping in the upper or lower half of the picture. This keeps enough of the picture underneath the cursor so you don't loose touch while simultaneously revealing the next picture.
